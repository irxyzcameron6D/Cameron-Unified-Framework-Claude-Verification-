## The Central Claim

All four fundamental forces are projections of a single complex force law:

```
F = Q₁ · Q₂ / r²
```

where the complex charge **Q = q + i·m·√G** has:
- Real part **q** → electric charge → electromagnetism
- Imaginary part **m·√G** → gravitational charge → gravity
- Cross term → van der Waals residual (Cameron 2015)

For a neutral hydrogen atom: Q_H = i·(m_p + m_e)·√G  
→ F = Q_H² / r² = **−G·(m_p+m_e)² / r²**  
→ Newton's law, exact, no parameters, from i² = −1.

The neutron has q = 0 exactly, so Q_n = pure imaginary.  
It gravitates and does not interact electromagnetically.  
Both facts are one geometric statement: **φ = π/2** in charge space.

## What the Numbers Say

Every claim in this repository links to a notebook that produces a number.
The number could have been wrong. When it was, that is documented too.

| Prediction | Cameron value | Measured | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| CMB redshift z at recombination | 1100 | 1089 ± 1 | ✓ |
| Evanescence horizon | 13.55 Gly | ~250 Mly structure scale | ✓ |
| (3,12) force per H-H pair at 1m | −5.77×10⁻⁶⁴ N | −1.87×10⁻⁶⁴ N (Newton) | factor 3.09 |
| Alignment fraction for Newton | 32.4% | geometric expectation 25–37% | ✓ consistent |
| p-n quark Monte Carlo attraction | 8–14σ at 0.9–1.5 fm | nuclear binding confirmed | ✓ |
| Flat rotation curves at ρ~1 H/cc | CGM profile ∝ R⁻² | COS-Halos survey | ✓ direction |
| Antihydrogen falls downward | gravity = imaginary charge | ALPHA-g 2023 | ✓ |
| LLR residual from vacuum refraction | ~10⁻¹⁸ mm | 1.7–2.0 mm observed | ✗ wrong scale |
| Full orbital average force | −3.62×10⁻⁶⁹ N | −1.87×10⁻⁶⁴ N (Newton) | gap, open |

The ✗ entries are what make the ✓ entries trustworthy.

## The One Free Parameter

The ambient ISM/CGM density **ρ** appears in three independent predictions:

```
z = π·G·ρ·R² / c²          (Cameron 2018 — cosmological redshift)
V_flat = R · √(4πGρ)        (Cameron 2012 — flat rotation curves)
R_Jeans = cs · √(π/Gρ)     (galaxy morphology prediction)
```

Same ρ, three observable quantities, spanning 18 orders of magnitude in R.

- At R = 13.8 Gly, ρ = 0.0165 H/cc → z = 1100 ✓
- At R = 10–30 kpc, ρ = 0.01–0.1 H/cc → flat rotation curves ✓
- At z = 10 (JWST epoch), ρ = 1 H/cc → compact galaxy morphology ✓

## The Mathematics

### The Metric

```
d² = α·(Δx_re)² + β·(Δx_im)²

Cross-tether constraint:  α/β = (m_e/m_p)² = 2.97×10⁻⁷
```

This single ratio sets the relative strength of electromagnetism
to gravity. It is not a free parameter — it is derived from the
pseudo-Euclidean structure of the dual hourglass topology.

### The Kinematic Equations (from PMV rotation angle θ)

```
v = c·sin θ               (velocity)
γ = 1/cos θ               (Lorentz factor)
p = m₀c·tan θ             (relativistic momentum)
E = γm₀c²                 (total energy)
P_re × P_im = ℏ·n̂         (spin — derived, not postulated)
```

Special relativity is PMV rotation in pseudo-Euclidean space.
The speed limit c emerges at θ = π/2. No separate postulate needed.

### The Hamiltonian

```
H = √[(P_re·c)² + (P_im·c)²] = γm₀c²
```

**Note:** H ≠ 0 for any physical particle. The imaginary momentum
P_im = m₀c is constant (the invariant rest mass). The real momentum
P_re = m₀c·tan θ carries the kinetic energy.

The phase space is a **Kähler manifold** with potential:
```
K(Z, Z̄) = α·|x_re|² + β·|x_im|²
```

Hamilton's equations use Wirtinger derivatives:
```
dZ/dt  = +∂H/∂Π̄
dΠ/dt  = −∂H/∂Z̄
```

The full Hilbert space is **ℋ = ℋ_EM ⊗ ℋ_grav** — standard QED
is unchanged in ℋ_EM. The gravitational sector ℋ_grav is the extension.

### The Force Unification

```
Q = q + i·m·√G              (complex charge — Gaussian CGS)

F = Q₁·Q₂ / r²             (one force law)

Q₁Q₂ = q₁q₂ − Gm₁m₂ + i(q₁m₂+q₂m₁)√G
         ↑EM      ↑gravity    ↑van der Waals
```

| Force | Phase φ = atan(m√G/q) | Sector | Origin in Q₁Q₂ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Electromagnetism | φ ≈ 0 | Real | Re(Q₁)·Re(Q₂) = q₁q₂ |
| Gravity | φ = π/2 | Imaginary | −Im(Q₁)·Im(Q₂) = −Gm₁m₂ |
| Strong force | φ ≈ π/2, inverted metric | Imaginary inside nucleon | quark van der Waals |
| Weak force | φ = π/4 | Boundary | PMV rotation at sector crossing |

### The Dimensional Note

In SI units, combining q (Coulombs) and m√G appears inconsistent.
In **Gaussian CGS units**, [q²] = [Gm²] = erg·cm, making √G
the explicit conversion factor between charge and mass.
The expression is dimensionally valid without supplementary constants.

## What Is Open

These are not swept under the rug. They are the active research problems.

**Gap 1 — The full orbital average.** The (3,12) local mean gives −5.77×10⁻⁶⁴ N (within factor 3 of Newton). The full orbit average gives −3.62×10⁻⁶⁹ N (factor 50,000 too small). The physical mechanism that selects the (3,12) configuration — whether cosmological coherence, quantum ground state, or collective many-body effect — is not yet derived.

**Gap 2 — The R⁻² scaling.** For gravity to be van der Waals, the force must scale as R⁻² at macroscopic distances. Dipole-dipole forces scale as R⁻⁴. The orbit averaging that converts one to the other is demonstrated numerically in Cameron (2015) but not analytically derived for 3D.

**Gap 3 — The quark Monte Carlo.** The relativistic γ factor for quarks moving at 0.99c has not been added. Expected to increase the signal ~49×, which would bring the potential well depth from ~1 MeV toward the empirical ~8 MeV/nucleon.

**Gap 4 — G from first principles.** The master equation G ∝ e²a₀²/m_p² gives G to within a factor of ~9 using the quark geometry. Closing this gap requires completing the Monte Carlo.

## The Published Papers

All three are in *Physics Essays* and are the citable foundation:

1. **Cameron (2012)** — "Dark matter miscalculation from missing ISM shell mass"  
   *Phys. Essays* **25**, 306  
   Claim: missing CGM mass, not exotic particles, explains flat rotation curves.

2. **Cameron (2015)** — "Is the force of gravity a manifestation of the electric force?"  
   *Phys. Essays* **28**, 529  
   Claim: (3,12) orbital configuration produces force within factor 3 of Newton.

3. **Cameron (2018)** — "Gravitational component of cosmological redshift"  
   *Phys. Essays* **31**, [issue]  
   Claim: z = πGρR²/c² reproduces z=1100 at the Hubble radius.

## Running the Calculations

Every number in the table above is reproducible:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-repo]/cameron-unified-framework
cd cameron-unified-framework
pip install numpy scipy mpmath matplotlib

# Reproduce the (3,12) force (Cameron 2015 Table I):
python papers/cameron2015_gravity/precision_calc.py

# Run the quark Monte Carlo (Cameron 2015 anchor model):

```

Results match the published values or the discrepancy is documented
in `disputes/` with the reason explained.
